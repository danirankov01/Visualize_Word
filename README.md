For this project I used Tkinter and DALLE API. First thing I did in Tkinter is to create window, input label and button which is rendering photo. It's basically check if the input is empty and give the user message to write something in the input box, otherwise the program is sending query to the API, which is creating the photo and when is returning it to us we handle it with the display image who is taking the whole photo, saves it in the RAM of the computer and display it.
